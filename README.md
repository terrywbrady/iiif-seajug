## Abstract

The [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](http://iiif.io) is a collection of standards and API's for sharing and presenting image content.  The standard is being adopted by many academic and cultural institutions to present digital images.  When images are served from a IIIF-compliant image server, the images can be accessed by wide variety of iiif-compliant viewer applications.

The Georgetown University Library is early in our exploration of these standards.  Throughout the presentation, we will discuss the challenges that a library or cultural heritage organization faces in sharing digitized content and the opportunities that are enabled by the IIIF standards.  The availability of online, open-source, interoperable applications makes this a particularly fun technology to explore. 

This presentation will include a live demonstration of the configuration of a IIIF-compliant image server.  [Cantalope](https://medusa-project.github.io/cantaloupe/) is a java-based open-source IIIF image server.  The presentation will demonstrate the installation and configuration the Cantaloupe with a collection of images.  The presentation will demonstrate how the URL scheme of the IIIF Image API can be used to transform the am image and display the image in a collection of IIIF-compliant viewers.

Using an online "manifest" editor, we will use the IIIF presentation api to assemble a collection of images into a navigable image collection and demonstrate how this manifest can be rendered in a number of viewer applications.
